#### 2025
This is the first year in my life I am taking this seriously (2025). 

##### No videogames
I spent almost 3000 hours on videogames since Covid (2020).

I got my first videogame in 2009, when my dad got me a PS2. I remember spending so much time playing dragon ball z or sonic the hedgehog games. I have so many core memories from then till now of playing different games. I loved the competition, videogames fostered that in me since I was a child.

At the time, I still believe I needed it. I made a lot of close friends and learned a lot about myself. See [[How videogames changed my life]].

Now, it seems more like an obstacle I am bound too. I start a game, and I don't realize an hour or sometimes 4 or 5 have gone by. Whether I play with friends or by myself, it feels so mechanical that I rarely leave the game in a good mood. Usually a bit melancholic or frustrated.

As an experiment, I want to see what would happen if I cut out videogames.

The aim being to turn that videogaming time to something that is a bit more productive. Productive here meaning learning/refining something that's currently a [[Priorities and Goals|priority]] in my life.

I can't honestly say I have played zero videogames. I bought a meta quest 3s and played 1-2 hours of Batman, and spent a couple more hours trying out different games to get a feel of VR. I bought mostly because I wanted to learn how to program in VR. Might return it though.

However, my hours of play have gone down from ~15 hours/week to <1 hour/week. Still a huge win for me!

Going strong so far, although tempted to play marvel rivals. Human Torch dropped last week, and I sometimes miss playing as Star lord.

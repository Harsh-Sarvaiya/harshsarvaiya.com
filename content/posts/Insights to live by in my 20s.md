Some are abstract, some are practical. I will add things here whenever they come up.

Here's a list of insights/guidelines I have been trying to live by:

- No alcohol, intoxicants
- Try your best to eat healthy, it's tough at times. But put in the effort.
- Some Aerobic exercise every week (badminton, running, etc)
- Get stronger everyday. If you can't go to the gym, do:
	- Pushups
	- Crunches
	- Pullups - need to get a pull up bar asap.
- Spend time reflecting on things that need more/less time
- Invest your money - education, equities, precious metals, crypto
- Don't overspend on stupid stuff 
- Stay calm, assess situations and find solutions
- Quick and actionable solutions are often better than ones that are optimized but hurt momentum
	- Need to think of a better way to phrase this
- Be nice, give compliments when you appreciate something
- Help others when/where you can.
